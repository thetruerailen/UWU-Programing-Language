# UWU Programming Language

The UWU Programming Language is a simple interpreted language designed for fun and learning. It features basic variable assignment, mathematical operations, printing, function definition, importing external files, making requests, and executing commands.

## Getting Started

To run UWU programs, follow these steps:

1. Install Python 3 if you haven't already.
2. Save the `main.py` and `mymodule.py` files in the same directory.
3. Create a new `.uwu` file with your UWU code (e.g., `program.uwu`).

## Usage

To run a UWU program, use the following command:

```bash
python3 main.py <filename.uwu>
```

Replace `<filename.uwu>` with the path to your `.uwu` file.

## Syntax

### Variable Assignment

Variables can be assigned using the following syntax:

```bash
variable = value
```

Example:

```
uwu_variable = 42
```

### Printing

To print a message or variable, use the `pwint` keyword:

```
pwint("Hello, UWU!")
pwint(uwu_variable)
```


### Mathematical Operations

UWU supports basic mathematical operations:

- Addition: `+`
- Subtraction: `-`
- Multiplication: `*`
- Division: `/`
- Modulo: `%`
